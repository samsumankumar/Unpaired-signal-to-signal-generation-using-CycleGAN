# Unpaired-signal-to-signal-generation-using-CycleGAN

This code implements the generation of signal B if given signal A, where A is generated in B's style. This also works vice versa like a cycle.
The main aim of this project is to create some fake signals to train a different model for anomaly detection in electromagnetic signals.
This is an ongoing project, will update more on this in later stages.
